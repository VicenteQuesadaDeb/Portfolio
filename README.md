# Portfolio

In this project I'm going to build my own portfolio. I'm going to implement the best practices I've learn during my coding experience years.
Also I will try to explain the steps I'm taking to build it as easy and precise as I can.


First of all, I'm going to build it on ReactJS, a Framework based on JavaScript and HTML. We can create a blank project using create-react-app. Here is a little bit of information about this topic : https://en.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html


Steps taken:
- npx create-react-app portfolio

Now we can access and work on our blank project.

First of all, when we inicializate the project (yarn && yarn start) we can see the App.js file with the React logo spinning and a link to the reactjs.org site. That's fine to get started learning how React works and some basics (and advanced) resources to build ReactJS applications.
We are going to get rid of it, since we know what we want to do, a great, nice looking, proffesional and stylish portfolio.

We are going to get rid of the React logo and the link so we can have a blanck App.js file to modify. I will leave the styles by default at the beginning, because we are structuring our project first.

So, we can type whatever we want to add to our portfolio, this is complete personal. Some time ago I discovered an animation for ReactJs which I love. It's called react-typical. You can find it here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typical

We can see the result in the gif below:
